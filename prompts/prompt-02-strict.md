# Prompt 2: Add Strict Validations

Now add validation for these STRICT rules (violations block submission, no exceptions allowed):

1. Full Name: Cannot be blank. Minimum 2 characters. No numbers allowed.
2. Email: Must be valid email format (contains @ and a domain).
3. Phone: Exactly 10 digits. Must start with 6, 7, 8, or 9.
4. Highest Qualification: Must select one from the dropdown (cannot be empty).
5. Interview Status: If "Rejected" is selected, block submission entirely and show a red banner: "Rejected candidates cannot be enrolled."
6. Aadhaar Number: Exactly 12 digits. No alphabets or special characters.
7. Offer Letter Sent: Cannot be "Yes" unless Interview Status is "Cleared" or "Waitlisted".

Show validation errors INLINE below each field in red text as the user types or changes values. The submit button stays disabled until ALL strict rules pass.

## AI Reflection
- **What went right**: The AI implemented the inline error messages correctly for most fields.
- **What went wrong**: The phone number validation was too simple (just length check) and allowed non-numeric characters.
- **Correction**: I provided a specific regex `[6-9]\d{9}` in the next iteration to enforce Indian mobile standards.
